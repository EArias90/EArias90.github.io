# ApplicationName: Card Matching Game: Futbol Edition



## Game Objective: 

The objective is to pick a card and find its match. If the matching card is not selected then both cards will flip back to the original state. Once all cards are paired correctly the game will end.



## Technologies Used:


    - HTML
    - Javascript 
    - CSS 



## Approach: 

I wanted to make a simple layout game with not a lot of movement. I started with section tag and aligned it right in the middle of the page. From there, I would just continue to add Div tags until the 'card' boxes were setup to my liking. 

After that, I would move onto my javascript folder to make sure all the functions were corresponding with the items in the section.


## Things to revist

1: Add different levels - such as a side button that adds more cards.
2: A restart function

## Challenges: 

Getting started was the biggest challenge. I didn't know where to begin when it came to the layout. I didn't want to make a huge game as my first, even though, I would have liked to.
